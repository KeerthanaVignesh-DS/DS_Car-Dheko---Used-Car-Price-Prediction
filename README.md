# Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
"Car Dheko" is a machine learning-based project that predicts the prices of used cars based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The project involves multiple stages of data processing, machine learning model development, and deployment. The final product is an interactive web application deployed using Streamlit that allows users to input car details and receive price predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and removing outliers.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementing algorithms to predict used car prices based on historical data.
- **Web Application:** A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, where users can input car details and receive price predictions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis of the dataset to understand patterns and correlations between features.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python (Flask for API, Scikit-learn for machine learning models)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit for web deployment
- **Database:** MongoDB (for storing car data and user submissions)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit, Docker, and Apache (on Rocky Linux)
